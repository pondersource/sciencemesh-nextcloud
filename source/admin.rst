Admin Documentation
===================
Configure "iopUrl" to point to your revad instance. You can check this value in your Nextcloud database::

  select * from oc_appconfig where appid='sciencemesh';

Make sure that `revaSharedSecret` in there matches the `shared_secret` entry in the following sections of your revad.toml file:

* [grpc.services.storageprovider.drivers.nextcloud]
* [grpc.services.authprovider.auth_managers.nextcloud]
* [grpc.services.userprovider.drivers.nextcloud]
* [grpc.services.ocmcore.drivers.nextcloud]
* [grpc.services.ocmshareprovider.drivers.nextcloud]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can set some manually estimated statistics data in the admin interface of the Nextcloud app.
You can follow the instructions on https://sciencemesh.io/ to add your site to the ScienceMesh directory.
Once that is complete, other sites will update their approved providers whitelists.
